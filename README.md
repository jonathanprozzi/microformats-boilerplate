# Microformats Boilerplate HTML

## Purpose

The purpose of the _index.html_ and _post.html_ files is to create a straight-forward HTML boilerplate for both a main page (index.html) and sample single post (post.html).

The goal is to use this as a quick way to troubleshoot any missing Microformats and include them before turning this into React components for a Gatsby starter.

I've been running it through the [Microformats Parser](https://php.microformats.io/) to check for errors, but I'm open to feedback about anything that seems to be missing. I tried to achieve a balance betwen including crucial Microformats markup and optional Microformats markup.

Please provide feedback!

Thanks!
